## Error of a Hypothesis
---
- **Def:** the **true error** of a hypothesis with respect to concept $c \ \epsilon \ C$ and distribution $D$, denoted error $_D(h)$, is the probability that h will misclassify an instance drawn from $\mathbb{X}$ according to $D$
- **Def:** We say a version space $VS(H,D)$ is $\epsilon$ - exhausted if ____?

## Theorem
---
- **Theorem:** If the hypothesis space $H$ is finite and $\mathbb{X} \subset X$ is a sequence of $m \geq 1$ independent randome examples of some target ocncept c, then for $0 \leq \epsilon \leq 1$ The probability that $VS(H,D)$ is not $\epsilon$ - exhausted is less than or equal to $|H|e^{-\epsilon m}$
