## Assignments
-----------
- Email to amy.peerlinck@student.montana.edu your group of 4 students
- Assignment 1 due 9/13

## Expectations
---
- Four projects
  - Design document (except for Assignment 1)
  - Paper (Max 10 pages, JMLR/JAIR format, PDF)
  - Use Overleaf for Latex
  - Code + Team Contribution (**FULLY DOCUMENTED CODE**)
  - 1 Paper per group
  - Video detailing code works (max 5 min)

## Machine Learning
---
- **Paradigms**
  - Supervised
  - Unsupervised
      - Most well known form is Clustering
  - Reinforcement Learning
      - Agent can take actions and receives either positive or negative reinforcement based on its actions
- **Modes**
  - Active
      - Model you are using will actively query the user based on specific examples
  - Passive
  - Helpful teacher
      - Less queries to the user, but the queries are much more specific.
      - Queries will be the best examples chosen by the model
  - Online
      - Online learning new data is coming in
      - Fitness tracker is a good example
  - Offline
      - Not receiving new data
- **Indctive Bias**
  - Model is making an assumption about the data, it is inclined to learn a certain way
  - Representation bias
    - What is available, what the model can represent
    - Decision tree is a good example
  - Preference
    - Which representation your model is going to prefer
    - Neural networks dont have representation bias, it has a preference bias, it will prefer to use the most simple neural network that it can
    - Overfitting problem: the neural network sees examples so often that it "forgets" to create a generalization
- **NO FREE LUNCH**
  - You dont know what model is going to best fit the problem

## Things to do
---
- **BRUSH UP ON PROBABILITY**
