## Missing Values
---
- Remove rows if a small percentage if total
- Perform data imputation: **If a large percentage of rows are missing values**
  - Randomly generate a number
  - Use a probability distribution based on available values for the class the datapoint belongs to

## Hyperparameters
---
- Support Vector Machine
  - Regularization constant
  - Kernel
- Neural Networks
  - Momentum
  - Activation function
  - \# layers
  - \# hidden nodes per layer
  - ...
- Genetic Algorithms
  - Population size
  - Crossover & mutation rates (common values 0.01)
  - ...

# Tuning

<big>Tuning is the optimization of algorithm parameters.</big>

## Grid search

- Regularization constant: {10, 100, 250, 500}

- Kernel: {.1, .3, .5, .7, 1}

- Total of 20 possible combinations = training your model 20 times

- If you use 10-fold cross validation each time: 200 runs for ONE data set

## Random search

- Randomly selects parameter combinations

## Algorithmic methods

- Evolutionary algorithms

- Gradient descent

- ...
## Validation techniques
---
- Hold-out
  - Split into training and testing sets
  - Common 80/20 split
- **k-fold cross validation**
  - Split data in k equally sized subsets
  - Use k-1 subsets as training set and the kth subset as testing set (folds dont have to be exactly equal in size, i.e one fold can be 10 another can be 9)
  - Repeat k times iterating through the subsets
- Stratified cross validation
  - Data has a certain portion of different classes
  - Maintain these class proportions in each subset
- 5 x 2 cross validation
  - 2-fold cross validation
  - Performed 5 times

- $Accuracy = (TP + TN) / All$
- $Precision = TP / (TP + FP)$
- $Fall-out = FP / (FP + TN)$
- $Recall = TP / (TP + FN)$

## Statistical Evaluation
- Hypothesis testing
  - State null-hypothesis
  - State statistical assumptions (e.g. statistical independence, distribution of observations)
  - Determine the test statistic (e.g. Student's t-test)
  - Select the significance level $a$ (e.g 5% or 1%) which indicates if the hypothesis will be rejected
  - Reject or confirm the null-hypothesis based on the outcome
- Confidence intervals: Social sciences typically use 5% while hard sciences typically use 1%
- **YOU CAN USE STATS LIBRARIES I.E T-TEST**

# Reminders
1. Project 1 is due **Friday 9/13** by **2:10 PM**
2. You CANNOT use machine learning libraries
3. Libraries to improve computational efficiency are acceptable (e.g. pandas, numpy to a certain extent, Java math, ...)
4. Report itself
   1. JMLR/JAIR formatting
   2. Submit a **PDF**
   3. 10 page max. (including references!!)
   4. Please do not forget to reference each algorithm and technique... PLEASE REFERENCE PROPERLY! Probably use LaTeX
      1. Find scientific article.
   5. Don't forget to state your hypothesis clearly!
   6. Discuss whether your hypothesis clearly!
   7. Discuss whether your hypothesis was confirmed or denied based on experimental results
   8. SHOW THESE RESULTS (a table is sufficient if you dont want to mess around with graphics)
5. Go see the TA or e-mail the TA if anything is unclear!
