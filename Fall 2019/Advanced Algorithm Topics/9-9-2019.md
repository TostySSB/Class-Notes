## Team Homework Assignment 1
---
- Divide and conquer probably
- Make note of any assumtions you make

## Randomized Algorithms
---
- **Deterministic Algorithm:**  an algorithm that will produce the same output given the same input every time.
- Analysis of runtime is often the average case analysis.
- **Stable Sort:** a sort that does not change the order of equally-valued inputs.
## Worst Case Runtime of RQuicksort:
---
- occurs when rand. element is the largest element.
