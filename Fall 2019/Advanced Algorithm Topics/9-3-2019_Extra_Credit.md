# Glimpses into the Calculus of Variations

## What did you learn?

- That all animals seem to know that the shortest distance between two points is along a straight line, and that that is a general axiom.

- That the Greek didn't have properly-suited language to describe curves

- That Heron proves the shortest path between any number of reflecting mirrors is obtained by using the line through the mirror to the imaginary reflected points.

- Light travels the shortest distance between two points.

- Fermat (1662) the laws of reflection and refraction are achieved by paths along which the light ray travels in the shortest time

- That scientists used to receive math problems in the mail.

- Bott Periodicity theory deals with the topology of 3d objects

- Calculus still works in infinite dimensions

## Were there any algorithms involved? (Even if not explicitly discussed).

- Variations of algorithms that solve the shortest path problem, e.g. Bellman-Ford.

- Variations of Euler-Lagrange equations?

- Deep-learning algorithms.

- When attempting to prove a circle contains the largest area for a given perimeter, you repeatedly alter the circle and look for an alteration where the derivative is zero, i.e it's the same or larger than a circle.

## What is a piece of advise that you took away?

- To not trust Wikipedia.

## Did an audience member ask a question that you particularly liked or disliked?

- I couldn't hear the only question, but it sounded good.

## Is there a question that you wish you could have asked but didn't?

- When did people stop mailing people math problems? â€” or do people still do that?

## If related to the event, what were you thinking about as you were leaving?

- How did the Greeks come to such complicated axioms with such primitive technologies?

- Were all of the Greeks wildly educated?

- What are manifolds?

- What is the Palais-Smale theorem/condition

## Did this event inspire you to look something up after the event? If so, what was it?

- Heron's proof.

- Machine Learning and Deep Learning

## Did you meet someone new at this event who you could see as a mentor / mentee / collaborator in the future?

- No, I did not.

## What is your take-away message from this event?

- That math is difficult.
