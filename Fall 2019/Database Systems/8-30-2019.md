## Database schemas (schemeata)
---
- Database schema
  - Data(record) structure

## Database State
---
- When defining a new database
  - Specify the databases schema to the DBMS
  - No data in the database - called the empty state
- **Initial state**
  - When the database is first populated
- Every time the database is updated we get another database state i.e current state
  - Data at a given time in the database is called **database state** or **snapshot**

## Database system design goals
---
- Self-describing
- Insulation of programs and data (program-data and program-operation independence)
- Support of multiple user views
## Internal schema
---
- In the internal level
- Describes the physical structure
- Access paths
  - Search structure that allows finding of records by attributes
  - Uses indexing, or hashing
  - May be optimized for different common-case queries
## Conceptual schema
---
- In the conceptual level
- Hides the details of the physical storage structure
- Entities
  - Represent real-world objects

## External schema (user views)
---
- Provides separate views to different users
- Permits only certain operations
- Execute **stored procedures i.e compute_GPA(student_id)**

## Data Independence
---
- **Logical data independence**
  - change the conceptual schema without having to change external schemas or application programs
## DBMS Languages
---
- Data definition language (DDL)
  - Conceptual and internal schemas
- Storage definition language (SDL)
  - internal schea
- Data manipulation language (DML)
  - Means for users to manipulate the database
  - Retrieval, insertion, deletion, and modification of the data
- In current DBMSs, these languages are often not considered distinct languages
